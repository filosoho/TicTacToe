# TicTacToe
Text-Based Tic Tac Toe Game.  A simple text-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.  

# About the Game
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid.  

This implementation of the game allows two players to take turns and provides a simple text-based interface for playing.  

# How to Play  
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.  
Players take turns entering their moves.  
Players enter their moves by specifying a number between 1 and 9 (corresponding to the grid positions), and their symbol (X or O) will be placed on the board.  
The game checks for a winner after each move. The player who first gets three of their symbols in a row wins.  
If all the positions on the board are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.
